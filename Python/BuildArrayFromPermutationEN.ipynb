The QuestionProblem: Build Array from PermutationGiven a zero-based permutation nums (0-indexed), build an array ans of the same length where ans[i] = nums[nums[i]] for each $0 \\le i < nums.length$ and return it.Note: A zero-based permutation is an array containing distinct integers from $0$ to $n-1$."

    "3. The ExplanationThe logic here is Nested Indexing. Instead of just taking the value at the current position $i$, we use that value as a \"pointer\" to look up another value within the same array.Time Complexity: $O(n)$ because we visit each index exactly once.Space Complexity: $O(n)$ because we create a new array to store the results.\n",

    "4. The Analogy: The Treasure Map Hunt 🗺️Imagine you are playing a game with 5 boxes. Each box has a number inside.You go to Box 0. Inside, there is a note saying: \"Look in Box 2.\"You go to Box 2 and find the actual prize.You write down the prize from Box 2 as the result for your first position.You are simply following a \"double-jump\" instruction to find the final value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Real-Life Example: The Office Directory 🏢Imagine you are looking for a manager in a large company.You look at the Reception List (Index $i$).The list doesn't give you the manager's name; it gives you the Office Number (nums[i]).You go to that Office Number and look at the nameplate on the door (nums[nums[i]]).That nameplate is your final result."
